# Minimal, Responsive, Pure Javascript, Single Page App
### Features:
No frameworks used, just pure Javascript (a.k.a. vanilla Javascript), CSS, and HTML. Responsive containers, images, video, and text automatically adjust to fit accordingly across small and large screens.

[Demo site](https://y0.netlify.app/) contains my personal writing, feel free to fork this repo and use it as a template.

Default "display all posts" view at root directory, with posts auto-expanding upon scroll, shows a welcome intro message, plus navigation links.

Individual post view at unique URLs removes the welcome intro from display, and autoscrolls post header to top. Also clones a copy of the post navigation links shown in the post header, to the bottom of post.

### Light / Dark Mode
Automatically set to the users light/dark preference if detected, and saves user's selection to browser storage.

### Zoom In / Out
Simple text zoom, user setting saved to browser storage.

### Sticky Header and Go To Top Of Page
Dynamically transition based on scroll position.

### [Lightest Youtube Embed](https://github.com/i1li/lightest-youtube-embed)
Custom Youtube embedder, a bare amount of code responsively fits or stretches videos that only load once user clicks "show/hide" button.

### [Netlify Content Gate](https://github.com/i1li/netlify-content-gate)
Custom solution for a simple free content gating. Kept on a separate site for simplicity in this case, but easily integrated.
